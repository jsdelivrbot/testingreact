The 3 Important Keywords for Testing

describe

it

expect

purpose of wrapping specs in functions is to safely run tests without worrying about errors in code.

Anatomy of an assertion

expect(component).to.have.class('comment-box');

to.have.class = assertion matcher, how to compare two given values

When writing tests, we should list out what we care about:

Comment Box
We care about 
	It has a text area
	It has a button
	Entering text into the text area updates the text

Comment List
We care about
	it shows a comment in a li
	given a list of comments, it shows all the comments

write tests that allow other developers to refactor your code, so focused on the html output.
